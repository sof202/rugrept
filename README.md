# Rugrept

A `grep` CLI clone written in Rust. 

Does is do everything that `grep` does?

Hell no.

## Why make this

There's this 
[really nice video by LaurieWired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQZ81MbjKpU)
that goes over the history of `grep`. Since seeing this I've been very
intrigued by `grep`. I use `grep` basically every day and never really thought
about how and why it was created. This goes for every GNU core utility. I want
to learn how all of these work, even if it takes me way longer than the legends
that developed them in the first place.
